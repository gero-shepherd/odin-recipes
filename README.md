odin-recipes

This project is part of "The Odin Project" web development foundations course. 

I will be creating a basic recipe website using HTML. This website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 

Along with creating a standard HTML boilerplate, I will demonstrate the use of the following elements: <h1>-<h6>, <p>, <strong>, <a>, <img>, <em>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>.
