<p>Wow, doesn't that look amazing. Follow this recipe and you enjoy yourself one of these breakfast muffins at home!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
   <li>English Muffins</li>
   <li>Eggs</li>
   <li>Butter</li>
   <li>Bacon</li>
   <li>Cheese</li>
   <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>You want to render out as much fat as possible from the bacon. This is for two reasons: first is so the bacon goes nice and crispy. Second is you can use the leftover fat to toast the muffins.</li>
<li>There’s 2 eggs per sandwich, and you fry 4 at a time. It’s best to split the eggs into pairs (see below) so they fold into the sandwich easier. Fried eggs are notorious for sliding out of sandwiches!</li>
<li>Add cheese and toast your muffin!</li>
<li>You're done!</li>
